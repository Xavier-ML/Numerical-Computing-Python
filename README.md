# Numerical-Computing-Python
This Repo contains the python implementation of some Methods/Algorithms of the course Numerical Computing.
<br />
By using these pre made programs, you won't have to calculate each and every value of each iteration, using a calculator and writing by hand.
<br />
This way leave the traditional way of computing values, instead solve the entire questions by just entering thr input values
### How to Use
Start by cloning this repository
```ruby
git clone https://github.com/shahzaibk23/Numerical-Computing-Python
```
Once after the repo is cloned. <br />
Open the <b> NC.ipynb </b> file on <b> Jupyter Notebook </b> or any other editor that supports it.
<hr />
Run the specific method's shell, which you want, enter the input values given in question. And BOOM <br />
You'll get the whole solution on your screen.
<br />
The given Notebook contains the following Methods:
<ul>
  <li> Range-Kutta Method (R.K) </li>
  <li> False Position Method </li>
  <li> Bisection Method </li>
  <li> Newton Raphson Method </li>
  <li> Secant Method </li>
  <li> Jacobi Method </li>
  <li> Guess Seidal Method </li>
  <li> Modified Euler Method </li>
</ul>
